title: Does Evolution run on Linux?
---

Yes, there is a Linux build, but there won‘t be any Linux-specific features or bugfixes for that version. The linux version also lacks some features (e.g. export & import of save files). 

This is the only condition under which I am able to offer a Linux version at all. I don‘t have time for anything more than this regarding Linux.
