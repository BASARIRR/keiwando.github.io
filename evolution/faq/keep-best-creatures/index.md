title: What does the "Keep best Creatures" option do?
---

When this option is enabled, the two best creatures of a simulation run are copied to the next generation without any modifications (no recombination or mutation).

So, if you are only simulating two creatures per generation, you obviously should not enable this option. But then again, you should also be simulating way more than just two creatures in order to see good results.
