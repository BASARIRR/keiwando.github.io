title: Will you add translations for more languages?
---

At the moment, Evolution offers its help page in four languages: English, German, Russian and Portuguese. 

The UI is only available in English. 

Adding translations is time consuming  (especially in the long term) and not cheap, so I currently don‘t have the option to offer more translations for free unless somebody is willing to volunteer to translate the help page into another language (which I don‘t expect). 

If you do want to support this project by essentially donating a translation, thank you very much and feel free to contact me.
