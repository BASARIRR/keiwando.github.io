title: Evolution doesn’t download properly

If you are having issues with downloading the simulator (the download is getting stuck or doesn‘t start at all), please contact the respective store (App Store / Google Play / itch.io). This is a problem on their side that I unfortunately can‘t do anything about. 

Sometimes a simple restart of the browser or your device can help, too.
