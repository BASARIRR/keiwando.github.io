title: How can I load somebody else's creature design or simulation file?
---

For loading a creature design save:
* In the creature editor
* Click on the current creature name (or Unnamed) at the top
* Click on „Import“
* Select the .creat file that you want to load

For loading a simulation save:
* In the creature editor
* Click on „Simulations“
* Click on „Import“
* Select the .evol file that you want to load

.creat files contain creature designs. 
.evol files store entire simulations. 

On iOS and Android you can also select the save file outside of evolution and open it with / copy it to Evolution. (Evolution should show up in the list of applications that can open the file). This means that it is for example easily possible to AirDrop save files between different iOS devices.
