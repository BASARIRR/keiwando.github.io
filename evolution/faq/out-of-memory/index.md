title: I get an “Out of Memory" exception inside of the browser. What do I do?
---

The simulation requires a certain amount of memory, which makes it difficult when you want to run it in a browser. If you have too many creatures at once or let the simulation run for too long, you‘re running the risk of running out of Memory. 

If that is the case, just download one of the desktop or mobile versions. They are available on Mac, Windows, iOS, Android and there is even a Linux version (with limited features and support).
