<p><b>NativeFileSO</b> is a Unity asset which allows you to open and save files using the native dialogs on <b>Windows, macOS, iOS and Android </b>, all from a simple and unified interface. It also lets you associate arbitrary file types with your iOS and Android targets, which makes your app show up in the native share dialogs when a supported file type is being shared.</p>

<p> With all of the funcionality that NativeFileSO can offer, there are still some limitations due to platform specific constraints, so please make sure to carefully read the section on <a href="#Limitations">requirements & limitations</a> before deciding on a purchase.</p>

<p>If you happen to come across an issue with the asset, please <a href="https://www.github.com/keiwando/nativefileso/issues">file a bug</a> and I will try my best to solve the problem as quickly as I can.</p>

<h3 id="Limitations">Requirements & Limitations</h3>

Here are the main limitations and platform requirements for the asset that you should read and take into consideration before deciding on the purchase!

<div class="spacing-small"></div>

<h4> Windows </h4>
<ul class="bulleted-list">
	<li>The Windows build requires <b>.NET 2.0</b> (not subset!) and <b>Mono</b> (IL2CPP is not supported)</li>	
</ul>

<h4> macOS </h4>
<ul class="bulleted-list">
	<li>The Open and Save panels don’t show custom titles on OSX 10.11 and above.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Android </h4>
<ul class="bulleted-list">
	<li>Supports <b>Android 4.4+</b></li>
	<li>The Android File Browser doesn’t guarantee which file type is selected by the user (Can't filter files by extension and MIME types are unreliable too)</li>
	<li>File extensions cannot be reliably associated with the application on Android, so only the MIME type is used for the association. This is mainly important if your app supports a custom file type. In this case, you can set its MIME type to “application/octet-stream” or more generally associate every file type with your app (using a wildcard MIME type of “*/*”) and deal with invalid file types from within the app after the files have been loaded.</li>
</ul>

<h4> iOS </h4>
<ul class="bulleted-list">
	<li>Supports <b>iOS 11+</b></li>
	<li>Using “Copy to” with a UIActivityViewController only copies the first file of the selection to your app - this is an iOS limitation. Multiple files can be imported at once from within the app using the <a href="#">OpenFiles</a> function.</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Mobile (iOS + Android)</h4>
<ul class="bulleted-list">
	<li>The file associations only work for files that exist locally on the device. (The files are not downloaded and imported from an online URL.)</li>	
</ul>
